1. get all statuses, not repeating, alphabetically ordered
SELECT DISTINCT status from Tasks
ORDER  BY status ASC;

2. get the count of all tasks in each project, order by tasks count descending
SELECT P.name, COUNT(T.name)
FROM Projects P
INNER JOIN Tasks T
on P.id = T.project_id
GROUP BY P.name
ORDER BY COUNT(T.name) desc;

3. get the count of all tasks in each project, order by projects names
SELECT P.name, COUNT(T.name)
FROM Projects P
INNER JOIN Tasks T
on P.id = T.project_id
GROUP BY P.name
ORDER BY P.name;

4. get the tasks for all projects having the name beginning with “N” letter
SELECT name
FROM Tasks
WHERE name like 'N%';

5. get the list of all projects containing the ‘a’ letter in the middle of the name, and
show the tasks count near each project. Mention that there can exist projects without
tasks and tasks with project_id=NULL
SELECT P.name, COUNT(T.name)
FROM Projects P
FULL OUTER JOIN Tasks T
on P.id = T.project_id
GROUP BY P.name

6. get the list of tasks with duplicate names. Order alphabetically
SELECT name
FROM Tasks
GROUP BY name
HAVING COUNT(name) > 1
ORDER BY name

7. get the list of tasks having several exact matches of both name and status, from the project ‘Garage’. Order by matches count
SELECT  T.name
FROM Projects P
INNER JOIN Tasks T
on P.id = T.project_id
WHERE P.name = 'Garage'
GROUP BY T.name, T.status
HAVING COUNT(T.name) > 1 AND COUNT(T.status) > 1
ORDER BY COUNT(T.name), COUNT(T.status)

8. get the list of project names having more than 10 tasks in status ‘completed’. Order
by project_id
SELECT P.name 
FROM Projects P
WHERE P.id in ( SELECT T.project_id
FROM Tasks T
WHERE T.status = 'completed'
GROUP BY T.project_id
HAVING COUNT(T.name) >= 10)
